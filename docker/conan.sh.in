# There's numerous issues with wasm and Conan:
#   1. It assumes the toolchain versions is 13.0,
#       when it only supports up to 12.0. This requires
#       shipping a custom `settings.yml` file, which
#       is not fun. We ship with a custom toolchain that
#       effectively provides `ANY` for any compiler versions.
#   2. Can't easily change configuration settings via
#       `conan config set compiler.clang.version=ANY`.
#       This means distributing a `settings.yml` file.
#   3. Even if you do get the compiler version correct,
#       building with a Meson build system produces a warning
#       in wasm-ld, stating it's ignoring an unrecognized
#       option `-rpath`.
#   4. Building with `meson` and `cmake` still gets an issue, `unable to find <library>`,
#       because the files are incorrectly named. For example, `libz.a`
#       is actually named `libzlibstatic.a`. The solution is to trick
#       the compiler into using `Linux` as the operating system, which
#       isn't completely lying.
#
#   This last issue is solvable. Since vcpkg works out-of-the-box,
#   this isn't really a big issue.
